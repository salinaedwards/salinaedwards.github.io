Hello! My name is Salina. I am a recent MSc Neuroscience graduate from McMaster University. During my studies, I was awarded the CGS-M NSERC scholarship. I am passionate about understanding (or rather, trying to understand) how engaging with digital technologies, including AI, affect human agency, perception, and decision-making processes. <br><br>

In my spare time, I make tufted rug art, hang out with my bunny, play hockey, and lose games in chess! NYT crossword level: Thursday.
