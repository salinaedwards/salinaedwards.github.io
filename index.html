    Hello! I'm Salina&mdash;a recent MSc Neuroscience graduate from McMaster University, originally from a cattle ranch in Northern BC. During my graduate studies, I was awarded the CGS-M (NSERC) scholarship for my work. <br><br>
    I am passionate about understanding (or rather, trying to understand) how engaging with digital technologies, including AI, affect human agency, perception, and decision-making processes. <br><br>
    In my spare time, I make tufted rug art, hang out with my bunny, play hockey, and lose games in chess! NYT crossword level: Thursday. <br><br>
