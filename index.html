Hello! My name is Salina. I am a recent MSc Neuroscience Graduate from McMaster University. 

I am passionate about understanding (or trying to understand) how people interact with digital technologies, including AI!

In my spare time I make Rug Art, hang out with my bunny, and lose games in chess! NYT crossword level: Thursday.
